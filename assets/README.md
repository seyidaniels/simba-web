# ASSETS

This directory contains your un-compiled assets such as LESS, SASS, or JavaScript.

### Usage
Inside your vue templates, if you need to link to your assets directory use <code>~/assets/your_image.png</code> with a slash before assets.

Inside your css files, if you need to reference your  assets  directory, use <code>~assets/your_image.png</code> (without a slash)


More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/assets#webpacked).
